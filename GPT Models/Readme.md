# GPT Overview:

Generative Pre-trained Transformers are a family of neural network models that uses the transformer architecture for powering generative AI applications such as ChatGPT. We are interested in analyzing the causal reasoning ability of the GPT models present in the "OpenAI" platform.

We performed the experiment using the CLADDER dataset on the below 2 versions of CHATGPT
### GPT-3-TURBO
### GPT-4-TURBO

The python scripts used for testing the models are present in the individual folders along their performance results on various classifications of the Dataset.

Note: Ensure the paths for reading the CLADDER data and storing the results are consistent to your expectation.
